# First_Prjs_C

## Overview

Welcome to **First_Prjs_C**! This repository showcases my journey through the world of **C programming**, from learning the basics to tackling more advanced low-level programming concepts. It contains my first C programs, a mini-game I developed, and some more intricate projects that focus on the core principles of computer science and software development.

Whether you're a beginner in C or looking for examples of low-level programming, this repo provides insights into creating functional programs, understanding memory management, and optimizing performance.

**First_Prjs_C** is a collection of my first projects in **C** programming . This repository contains different directories, each representing a small project that covers fundamental concepts of C language, such as loops, conditions, functions, pointers, file handling, and more. These projects helped me build a strong foundation in C programming.
