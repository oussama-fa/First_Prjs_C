# First_Prjs_C

## Overview

Welcome to **First_Prjs_C**! This repository showcases my journey through the world of **C programming**, from learning the basics to tackling more advanced low-level programming concepts. It contains my first C programs, a mini-game I developed, and some more intricate projects that focus on the core principles of computer science and software development.

Whether you're a beginner in C or looking for examples of low-level programming, this repo provides insights into creating functional programs, understanding memory management, and optimizing performance.

## Projects Included

- **Beginner C Programs**  
  This section contains simple programs that helped me learn the basics of C, such as loops, conditionals, and functions. These programs represent the foundation of my journey into programming.

- **Mini Game**  
  I developed a simple yet fun mini-game that lets you interact with the computer in a playful way. This was a great project for applying my understanding of C in an interactive setting, working with user inputs, and managing game logic.

- **Low-Level Programming**  
  Dive into some advanced topics like memory management, pointers, and bitwise operations. These projects challenge the boundaries of what can be done at the system level and deepen my understanding of how programs interact with hardware.
